During this period, I was working without a contract, and I had a monthly payment through the resources of the laboratory supervisor grant (Dr. Hamidreza Hamidi in the first three years and Dr. Mehdi Ba-Haghighat in the last two years). Most of my activities in this laboratory were research, publishing scientific articles, academic books, and scientific analytical reports. Our research field was computer security. All these things were done without special sponsors and to improve the scientific resumes of the laboratory. In addition to these cases, I performed some teaching assistant activities and collaborated on two scientific final projects for the students. These final projects were further developed and publicly published as tools on the laboratory website and GitHub.<br>&bull;<br>Visiting Lecturer, 2019 &ndash; 2020, Imam Khomeini International University, Iran<br>I have taught some courses, including introductory programming, software testing (focusing on secure computing), and research and presentation methods at this university (252 hours in total). A contract was arranged for me to temporarily teach one or more courses for one or two semesters for payment.<br>&bull;<br>Visiting Lecturer, 2017 &ndash; 2017, Bu-Ali Sina, Iran<br>I have taught three separate operating system lab classes at this university. A contract was arranged for me to temporarily teach for payment.<br>&bull;<br>Elmemdad Website and Coinfa Project<br>To manage my living expenses in 2019, I launched a website on the internet domain of ElamEmdad.ir. On this website, I used to teach general computer courses and some programming or simulation tools. After some time, I asked some friends to make a scientific tutorial in General Computer Science for my website in exchange for some money. After some time, sales started from my website, and in the next few years, it was a financial aid for me. A few years later, I studied to research blockchain technology because I was very interested in blockchain (as a new technology). In this regard, I set up a news page and a YouTube educational channel to produce content besides studying. So far, I have not had any particular income from these two, and I have only been able to receive a few ads. However, it has dramatically helped me with blockchain knowledge and familiarity with the projects.<br>Award &amp; Honors<br>&bull;<br>Top educational student in MS.c (The first student among the entries in the field of study).<br>&bull;<br>Top educational student in BS.c (The second student among the entries in the field of study).<br>&bull;<br>Among the 0.004 top candidates in entrance exams of Iranian universities in Iran&apos;s IT engineering master&apos;s level - 2015<br>&bull;<br>The first place in the software section of the Pak University Festival in the undergraduate course (a festival consisting of several Iranian universities)<br>&bull;<br>Several Bug Bunty awards from some international companies.<br>Technical &amp; Research Experience<br>Patent:<br>1.<br>Pishdar, M. &amp; Daneshmand, D.
