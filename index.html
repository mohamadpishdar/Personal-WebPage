<p><strong>International Computer Science Researcher, 2024 – Now</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>International Computer Science Researcher, 2024 – Present</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been researching with different Professors around the world for more than 1 year. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>Remote blockchain Security   Freelancer, 2024 September – 2024 December, QRZCB, Italy Rome</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As a project-oriented freelancer, I am security testing websites,  smart contracts, and intermediaries related to blockchain for this project.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>Computer Science Researcher, 2018 – 2023,  Imam Khomeini International University, Iran </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I volunteered in the research laboratory environment for scientific  promotion for five years. During this period, I was working without a contract,  and I had a monthly payment through the resources of the laboratory supervisor  grant (Dr. Hamidreza Hamidi in the first three years and Dr. Mehdi Ba-Haghighat  in the last two years). Most of my activities in this laboratory were research,  publishing scientific articles, academic books, and scientific analytical  reports. Our research field was computer security. All these things were done  without special sponsors and to improve the scientific resumes of the  laboratory. In addition to these cases, I performed some teaching assistant  activities and collaborated on two scientific final projects for the students.  These final projects were further developed and publicly published as tools on  the laboratory website and GitHub. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>Visiting Lecturer, 2019 – 2020, Imam  Khomeini International University, Iran </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have taught some courses, including introductory programming,  software testing (focusing on secure computing), and research and presentation  methods at this university (252 hours in total). A contract was arranged for me  to temporarily teach one or more courses for one or two semesters for payment. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>Visiting Lecturer, 2017 – 2017,  Bu-Ali Sina, Iran </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have taught three separate operating system lab classes at this  university. A contract was arranged for me to temporarily teach for payment. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>Elmemdad Website and Coinfa Project </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To manage my living expenses in 2019, I launched a website on the  internet domain of ElamEmdad.ir. On this website, I used to teach general  computer courses and some programming or simulation tools. After some time, I  asked some friends to make a scientific tutorial in General Computer Science  for my website in exchange for some money. After some time, sales started from  my website, and in the next few years, it was a financial aid for me. A few  years later, I studied to research blockchain technology because I was very  interested in blockchain (as a new technology). In this regard, I set up a news  page and a YouTube educational channel to produce content besides studying. So  far, I have not had any particular income from these two, and I have only been  able to receive a few ads. However, it has dramatically helped me with  blockchain knowledge and familiarity with the projects. </p>
